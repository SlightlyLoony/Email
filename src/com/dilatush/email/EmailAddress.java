    The domain name part of an email address has to conform to strict guidelines: it must match the requirements for a hostname, a list of
    dot-separated DNS labels, each label being limited to a length of 63 characters and consisting of:[5]:ยง2


        uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
        digits 0 to 9, provided that top-level domain names are not all-numeric;
        hyphen -, provided that it is not the first or last character.

        This rule is known as the LDH rule (letters, digits, hyphen). In addition, the domain may be an IP address literal, surrounded by square
        brackets [], such as jsmith@[192.168.2.1] or jsmith@[IPv6:2001:db8::1], although this is rarely seen except in email spam. Internationalized
        domain names (which are encoded to comply with the requirements for a hostname) allow for presentation of non-ASCII domains. In mail systems
         compliant with RFC 6531 and RFC 6532 an email address may be encoded as UTF-8, both a local-part as well as a domain name.

        Comments are allowed in the domain as well as in the local-part; for example, john.smith@(comment)example.com and
        john.smith@example.com(comment) are equivalent to john.smith@example.com.

        Reserved domains
        RFC 2606 specifies that certain domains, for example those intended for documentation and testing, should not be resolvable and that as a
        result mail addressed to mailboxes in them and their subdomains should be non-deliverable. Of note for e-mail are example, invalid,
        example.com, example.net, and example.org.
